# Pinterest Clone

## Introduction
This project is a front-end clone of the popular visual discovery engine, Pinterest. It focuses on replicating the visual aspects and user experience of Pinterest's landing/home page using modern front-end technologies.

## Features
- **Landing/Home Page**: A beautifully designed landing page that resembles Pinterest's style and layout.
- **Interactive UI**: Enhanced user experience with interactive elements and animations.
- **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling the page, including layout and design elements.
- **GSAP + JavaScript**: For animations.
- **Locomotive**: Smooth scrolling and parallax effects.

## Installation and Setup
No installation is required. The website can be directly accessed if hosted, or by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage
Explore the landing page and enjoy the interactive features and animations that mimic Pinterest's design.

## Contributing
